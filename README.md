# Panda

A small project for our COP4331 course at UCF. 

It is a contacts manager application that allows sign in, sign up, and the:
- C: creation of contacts
- R: reading of contacts
- U: the updating of contacts
- D: the deleting of contacts

It is done in a LAMPAPI stack, implementing a mysql database, communicated through a php API, to our bootstrapped front end.
